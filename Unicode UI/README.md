# Unicode UI

This package adds experimental Unicode support to the Dolphin Smalltalk UI.

This may not be a complete or optimally efficient implementation.  This started as an experimental prototype to explore the concept of adding Unicode UI support to Dolphin Smalltalk. **This package makes system changes and should only be loaded in an experimental image.**

## How it Works
### Initial Creation of Unicode API Libraries
* The Unicode API library classes were created and the code in "CreateUnicodeLibraryMethods.st" was run to create all of the "...W" API function calls and redirectors.  **This has already been done and need not be rerun** unless regeneration is desired.
### Loading the Pacakage
1. The package loads code as normal, and includes the Unicode library classes (described above).
2. After a prompt, automated transforms are applied to the code base.  This approach was taken to facilitate ease of applying Unicode UI support to an independently evolving Dolphin core.  The results of these transforms are not captured into new packages. See the package scripts for more information.

## Areas in Need of Improvement:
1. Expand coverage of Unicode support as needed.  Presently most of the UI, and ODBC Databases have decent Unicode support.
2. Some of the transforms are simple text replacements.  It may be desirable to have more sophisticated parse tree aware transforms.
3. I haven't used this, "for real", if someone does then further areas in need of improvement will come up.
